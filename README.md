# RNA-Seq-Scripts
Contains my routine RNA-Seq Trimming, QC, and Mapping/Counting pipeline. It will not run independently and serves at this point as more of a template for my own reference. Once the directory strucure is created in the early lines the reads and reference transcriptome will need to be moved appropriately.
